      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        A junior Front-end Developer certified by SheCodes, a certified
        Professional Scrum Master (PSMI), and a former Nurse based in Viseu,
        Portugal.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a nurse I've developed a robust skill set that includes effective
        communication, teamwork, and the ability to thrive in high-pressure
        environments. These skills can be seamlessly transitioned into a IT
        career, where I bring a unique perspective and problem-solving
        abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey has taken me from healthcare to the dynamic world of IT and I
        am eager to connect and explore opportunities where I can leverage my
        healthcare background and IT skills to contribute to innovative and
        impactful projects.
